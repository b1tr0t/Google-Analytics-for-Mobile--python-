This package includes:

1) A direct translation of ga.py to ga.php.  You can probably integrate this into your own setup by importing 'track_page_view' and providing it with the appropriate WSGI request environment.  (From Django, you could probably pass in request.META directly, for example...)

2) A FLUP based FastCGI implementation in ga_mobile_server.py.  Set up nginx or Apache to call this

3) A startup script for the FLUP server in ga_mobile.  

4) A django app with a template tag you can use on your django site.
